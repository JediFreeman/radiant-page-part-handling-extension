= Page Part Handling

The idea of this extension is to load page parts over url parameters.

Example: http://www.mywebsite.ch/?part=extended

There are two use cases to start with this extension:
- a page that has several picture to scroll
- render just a part for an ajax update

So the extension has following funktions:
- AjaxPage: Page type that renders url parameter "part" without layout if it is an ajax request
- Tag contentByRequest: Renders url parameter "part" within layout

To cache all this part the radiant cache is extended.
